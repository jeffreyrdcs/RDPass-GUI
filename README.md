# RDPass GUI

RD-Pass is a simple password manager application developed using the Kivy python framework. It uses a database to store the credential entries with AES encryption. This repo is built on the command-line version of RDPass. The command-line only version can be found under my repo ./Exercise_projects/RDPass.
